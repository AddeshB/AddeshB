### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm currently a 3A undergraduate student at University of Waterloo, studying Mechatronics.

* I like learning new things, and lately during my free time have begun learning about Artificial Intelligence and its applications, especially in Computer Vision.

* As of May 7th 2021, I'm a Certified Tensorflow Developer

You can view my full certificate [here](https://www.credential.net/48d9d66b-fa7c-4a3b-a2a0-ad3bb2c76953)

* My journey into the field of AI though is far from over, so I look forward to learning more of this amazing field!
